# Small Projects in Applications in Linear Algebra

This <a href="[https://github.com/vincent1925/linalg/tree/main](https://vincent1925.github.io/linalg/)">link</a> contains the various problems I solved in Python using various linear algebra techniques as part of STAT 24320 Applications in Linear Algebra. I took this class because I felt apprehensive after taking STAT 24300 Linear Algebra and wanted more practice and also more application. All in all, I loved the class!
